# dotfiles

This is the configuration file for the linux environment that I usually use.

This will install the packages such as:

* git
    - git-flow

* curl
* python3
    - pip
    - virtualenv

* nodejs
    - npm
    - yarn

* docker
    - docker-compose

* firefox
* zsh
    - antigen
    - oh-my-zsh
        - git
        - pip
        - python
        - command-not-found
        - zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions
        - zsh-users/zsh-completions

If you need the same, you've come to the right repo.
